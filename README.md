# Java Library Management System with OOP Concepts

Welcome to the "Java Library Management System with OOP Concepts" repository! This project is designed to help you learn and showcase Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles through the development of a comprehensive Library Management System in Java.

## Key Features

- **Object-Oriented Design:** This project exemplifies essential OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. The codebase is organized into classes and objects, demonstrating the power of OOP in creating a maintainable, extensible, and modular system.

- **Library Management Functionality:** Experience a fully functional Library Management System with features like adding books, managing patrons, tracking borrowing and returning books, and generating reports. This project mirrors real-world library scenarios, emphasizing the practical application of OOP.

- **Documentation:** Clear and comprehensive documentation is provided to explain the project's structure, classes, methods, and database schema. This documentation serves as a valuable learning resource.

- **Comments and Code Style:** The code is well-commented and adheres to Java coding conventions, making it accessible for learners and promoting good coding practices.

- **Learning Resource:** Whether you are a novice or wish to strengthen your grasp of OOP, this repository offers a practical and hands-on learning experience. You can study the code, modify it, and experiment with various OOP concepts.

## How to Use
